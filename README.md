      WHY DATA SCIENCE

      I have always had an interest in learning more about computer technology.  
      I was one of three students who started the first computer programming class in high school.  
      I like to investigate and figure things out.  

      So, putting all those thing together –DataScience to me is a good fit.

### Sarah Wilson
      After the Covid Lock Down was issued the company I was working for as application support on a mainframe cobal program became laid off.
      Along with over 100 people due to loss of contract.  Having no formal certificates or degree in computer programming I was faced with a choice'
      to go back to school adding to the knowledge I had in the computer technology field or back to start over in a new career again.
      I have always been interested in the data side of analytics; I knew it would be a good fit for me.  This is a small part of WHY Data Science is for me.
